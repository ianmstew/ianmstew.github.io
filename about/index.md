<p class="stand-out">I love the front end.</p>

Seriously, everything about the front end.  Especially client side Javascript user interface architecture.  My specialty is taking a Photoshop document, advising on any apparent usability concerns, then building a pixel perfect, accessibility standards-compliant, cross-browser compatible rendition backed by scalable, reusable, bandwidth-sensitive UI architecture.

<p class="stand-out">I'm OCD about code beauty and structure.</p>

No, really.  [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/) keeps my code lint-free, and [JSCS](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) enforces my style guide.  This goes beyond a personal obsession and into the foundations for a scalable team who authors maintainable, visually compatible code.

<p class="stand-out">My Dev+Build Workflow can always be better.</p>

[Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) for compiling assets and workflow automation, [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) for assets management, [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) for speed.  Always automate repetitive manual tasks.

<p class="stand-out">No app is too small for decoupled, modular design.</p>

Every app component I create is as self-contained as possible.  App concerns are separated into isolated modules which communicate with each other only through the application event system.  Adding a new module, or even sharing modules between apps, requires little to no effort.

<p class="stand-out">CSS should be modular, too!</p>

[LESS](https://github.com/less/less.js/) is my preprocessor of choice, and I build each component with its own LESS file, usually not running past a page or two each.  When I rely on toolkits such as Bootstrap or Foundation, I import only what I use and keep customizations isolated from the toolkit code.  The result is a lean, maintainable, scalable style codebase.

I would love to grab coffee or a beer in [Center City Philadelphia](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.953824,-75.163214,3a,75y,193.15h,107.45t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1soHXFJIZA1b8e_EMIeh0vIg!2e0), if you happen to be in town.
